# React-jobs

This is a repository that shows react jobs only. You can add jobs, edit jobs, and even delete jobs. It has no backend yet since I have not learned backend development. This project was based on the course by [Traversy Media](https://github.com/bradtraversy) and I learnt this from YouTube.
